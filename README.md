# Collaborative-Drawer

This collaborative drawer app is written in Java and has the ability to connect multiple editors from different laptops simultaneously. An example of this is if someone draws a shape, the other person can draw over it and move it. This application was built in collaboration with the Dartmouth CS department and instructors such as Chris Bailey-Kellogg and Travis Peters.
